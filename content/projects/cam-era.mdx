Cam-Era is a smart home monitoring system with real-time camera feeds and alerts. I designed the application architecture and implemented the React frontend with seamless onboarding and service workers.

Highlights:

- Auto user authentication for faster onboarding
- Real-time camera feed handler and processor
- Event-driven alerts and background workers
- Python services with Django REST/FastAPI and deep-learning integrations

Tech stack: ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, Django REST API, FastAPI, Cloud Vault, WebSockets, Deep Learning model integration, Material UI, AWS.
