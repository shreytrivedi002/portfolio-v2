Requestify‑Nika is a pragmatic API testing tool that helps developers design requests, chain workflows, and automate validation across environments.

Highlights:

- Collections, folders, and environment variables
- Pre/post request scripts, assertions, and dynamic variables
- Auth helpers (Bearer/API key), file uploads, and GraphQL
- Import/export JSON collections for team sharing
- CLI runner for CI pipelines and scheduled monitors

Architecture:

- Next.js dashboard UI with CodeMirror and Tailwind
- Node/Express runtime for scripting and request execution (fetch/axios)
- Persistence via local IndexedDB or pluggable adapters (S3/Mongo)

Tech stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Tailwind, CodeMirror.
