Designed and implemented the backend powering city‑wide, real‑time bus tracking for Vibgyor Schools.

Responsibilities & scale:

- Live location updates over WebSockets to millions of users
- Thousands of concurrent routes with geo‑fencing and ETA updates
- Horizontal scalability with Kafka partitions and stateless services
- Caching layers and back‑pressure handling for bursty updates

Architecture:

- Ingestion: GPS devices → gateway → Kafka topics
- Backend: NestJS microservices (Kafka adapters), REST + WebSocket API
- State: Redis for presence/locations, PostGIS for geo operations
- Clients: Web/mobile apps subscribing to class/route topics

Tech stack: NestJS, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, WebSocket, Docker, Kubernetes.
